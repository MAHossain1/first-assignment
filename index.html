                Concentrate less on people and much on purpose. People can put your purpose in disarray; your purpose can put people in disarray. Stay focused; leave everything and do something.

        <p class="first-paragraph">
            If you want to go beyond limiting thoughts, you need to release yourself from the fear of the new and unfamiliar. I have heard so many times the sentence, “Stick to what you know best”, and I believe you have heard it too. As a child, it seemed like the right idea, but as I grew up, I felt exactly the opposite.

                    Every two seconds, someone in the Bangladesh needs blood. This could be a little girl in the ICU or a mother with Stage 3 leukemia. If you’re worried about needles, don’t be—most blood donors compare the experience to a mild, split-second pinch! The entire process is very safe and very fast, and you will feel amazing knowing you potentially saved up to three people.
